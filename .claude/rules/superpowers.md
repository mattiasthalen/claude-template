# Superpowers

- NEVER store plans and design specs in `docs/plans/`. Store plans in `docs/superpowers/plans/` and design specs in `docs/superpowers/specs/`.
- NEVER default plans to sequential execution. Optimize for parallelization.
- NEVER dispatch parallel subagents into the same worktree. Each subagent MUST work in its own isolated worktree (via `using-git-worktrees`).
- NEVER use `isolation: "worktree"` when the parent is on a non-main branch — it branches from main, not the parent branch. Create worktrees manually from the current branch (via `using-git-worktrees`) instead.
- NEVER write plans, specs, or implementation files before setting up an isolated worktree.
